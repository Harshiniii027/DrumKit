# Drum Kit Web Application

This project is a simple **Drum Kit** application where users can interact with the webpage by either clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Each interaction plays a different drum sound.

## Features

- **Click Events**: Users can click on buttons to produce sounds corresponding to different drum instruments.
- **Keyboard Events**: Users can press certain keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to produce drum sounds.
- **Dynamic Sound Handling**: The application uses the `Audio` object to dynamically play different sound files based on user interaction.

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained knowledge in the following areas:

### 1. **DOM Manipulation with `querySelectorAll`**
   - I learned how to use `document.querySelectorAll()` to select multiple elements and loop through them. This method helps attach event listeners to each button dynamically.
   
   ```javascript
   let b = document.querySelectorAll(".drum");
   ```

### 2. **Event Listeners and Handling Click Events**
   - By using the `addEventListener()` function, I understood how to handle user clicks on each drum button. I attached a click event listener to each button, which triggered the `makesound()` function to play the corresponding sound.
   
   ```javascript
   b[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
       let buttonClicked = this.innerHTML;
       makesound(buttonClicked);
   });
   ```

### 3. **Keyboard Event Handling**
   - I explored the `keydown` event and learned how to detect key presses on the keyboard. By capturing the `event.key`, I was able to call the same sound-producing function for both button clicks and key presses.

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
       makesound(event.key);
   });
   ```

### 4. **Switch Statement for Sound Mapping**
   - I used a `switch` statement to map each key or button press to the corresponding sound file. This helped me handle different cases based on user input and provided flexibility to add more sounds in the future.

   ```javascript
   switch (key) {
       case "w": new Audio("./sounds/crash.mp3").play(); break;
       case "a": new Audio("./sounds/kick-bass.mp3").play(); break;
       case "s": new Audio("./sounds/snare.mp3").play(); break;
       // ...more cases
   }
   ```

### 5. **Using the `Audio` Object**
   - I learned how to use the `Audio` object in JavaScript to play sound files. This was a crucial part of the project since it allowed me to dynamically trigger different sounds based on user actions.
   
   ```javascript
   var sound = new Audio("./sounds/snare.mp3");
   sound.play();
   ```

### 6. **Error Handling**
   - I added a `default` case in the switch statement to handle invalid inputs. This helped me prevent unexpected behavior and provide feedback (via an alert) when an incorrect button is pressed.

   ```javascript
   default:
       alert("Wrong Button Has been PressedðŸ˜²!!");
   ```

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to explore and solidify my understanding of basic **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **dynamic sound interaction** using the `Audio` object. I also learned how to use conditionals (switch statements) effectively to handle different user inputs. Overall, this was a fun and engaging way to learn JavaScript while creating an interactive web application.
